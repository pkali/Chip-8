# Chip-8
Chip-8 and Superchip-8 interpreter for Atari 8-bit

Progammed in 2005-2006, compiled with omc65.
Update 2024 - rewritten for mads and SpartaDosX / BW-DOS.

## v2.1
* much better error messages
* does not hang when CHIP8.CFG not found
* 4 new SuperChip8 games:

## v2.0, 2023-01-27
Command line interface.


Would be nice to add new games and joystick driven game selection.

My most important contribution to Chip-8 scene is the configuration file CHIP8.CFG - it contains mapping of Chip-8 keys to a joystick.
